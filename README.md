## Local Development

To run this website locally for development or testing:

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/blakelin-lsy/web-resume-chatllm.git
    cd web-resume-chatllm
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the application directory and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd app
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the site.

## Deployment

This site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

-   **Workflow Configuration:** The deployment process is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
-   **Next.js Configuration for GitHub Pages:**
    The `app/next.config.js` file is configured for static export suitable for GitHub Pages. Key settings include `output: 'export'`, and potentially `basePath` and `assetPrefix` if the site is hosted in a subdirectory of a domain (e.g., `your-username.github.io/repository-name`). For this project, `basePath: "/web-resume-chatllm"` and `assetPrefix: "/web-resume-chatllm/"` are used.
-   The `.nojekyll` file in the root of the repository ensures GitHub Pages serves the Next.js static export correctly without trying to process it with Jekyll.

You can monitor deployment progress in the "Actions" tab of the GitHub repository.

## Making Changes

To make changes to your resume website:

1.  Edit the files locally within the `app` directory.
2.  Commit your changes:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
    ```
3.  Push your changes to the `main` branch on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```
The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and deploy your changes to the live site.
