# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

## Files Already Set Up
Your repository already has most of the necessary configuration files for GitHub Pages deployment:

1. GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`:
   - `deploy.yml` - For deploying the Next.js app
   - `github-pages.yml` - For deploying a Jekyll site (if you're using Jekyll)

2. Next.js configuration:
   - `app/next.config.js` - Properly configured for static export with GitHub Pages paths

3. Package configuration:
   - `app/package.json` - Contains the necessary build scripts

## Missing File Added
- `.nojekyll` - This empty file has been added to the root of your repository to prevent GitHub Pages from processing your site with Jekyll.

## Deployment Steps

1. Add all files to git and commit them:
```bash
git add .nojekyll
git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment configuration"
```

2. Push to your GitHub repository:
```bash
git push origin main
```

3. Configure GitHub Pages in your repository settings:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Navigate to Settings > Pages
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"

4. Wait for the GitHub Actions workflow to complete:
   - You can monitor the progress in the "Actions" tab of your repository
   - Once completed, your site will be available at `https://[your-username].github.io/web-resume-chatllm/`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the deployment:

1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for error messages
2. Ensure your repository is public or you have GitHub Pages enabled for private repositories
3. Verify that the `basePath` and `assetPrefix` in `next.config.js` match your repository name
4. Make sure the build process completes successfully

For more detailed information, refer to the [Next.js documentation on static exports](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export) and [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).
